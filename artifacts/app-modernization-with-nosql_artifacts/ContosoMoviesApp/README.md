# Web application

Contoso Video uploaded a recent test build of their online video store and related projects. This has already been deployed to a web app running in your classroom Azure subscription. You can use this source code as a reference for determining query patterns and business logic. You will need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) running on a Windows machine with [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) in order to run it locally. Running it locally is optional, but could make the code evaluation process easier.
